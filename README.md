# Shared-Memory-Parallel-Computing-Proof-of-Concept
The aim of the program is averaging each array element with its four adjacent ones. Many of these operations will be independent from one another and can thus be executed parallelly. Being a shared memory architecture, threads are scheduled and executed on the same machine.
